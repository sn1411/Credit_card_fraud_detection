# Credit_card_fraud_detection
This project contains classification models which can be used by financial institutions to detect fraud credit card transactions.
# Case:
Assume that you are employed to help a credit card company to detect potential 
fraud cases so that the customers are ensured that they won't be charged for the 
items they did not purchase. You are given a dataset containing the transactions 
between people, the information that they are fraud or not, and you are asked to 
differentiate between them. This is the case we are going to deal with. Our ultimate 
intent is to tackle this situation by building classification models to classify and 
distinguish fraud transactions. I will be building six different types of classification 
models namely Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, 
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Steps Involved:
1. Importing the required packages into our python environment.
2. Importing the data
3. Processing the data to our needs and Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Feature Selection and Data Split
5. Building six types of classification models
6. Evaluating the created classification models using the evaluation metrics
